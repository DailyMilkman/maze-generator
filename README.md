# maze-generator
A visualization of a maze generation algorithm in JavaScript

The program can either be run in the browser, or you can simply run the .exe file in the folder

This is was created based off of the wikipedia page on maze generation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

Currently, increasing the dimensions of the maze results in a drop
in speed, so I'm working on optimizing the algorithm
