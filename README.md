# maze-generator
A visualization of a maze generation algorithm in JavaScript

This is was created based off of the wikipedia page on maze generation: \n
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

Currently, increasing the dimensions of the maze results in a drop
in speed, so I'm working on optimizing the algorithm
